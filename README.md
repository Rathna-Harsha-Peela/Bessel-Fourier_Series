# Bessel-Fourier_Series
## Bessel Series as Consequence of Solutions of Heat equation
      
This [Documentation](#bessel_fourier_Series.pdf) explains about how can the 
**Heat diffusion differential equation** be solved easily in Polar-Cordinates form, which otheriwse takes good amount of effort to solve in Cartesian Space beacuse of Boundary conditions (For circular aperture).
      
And interestingly it turns out that the **Solutions** are nothing but summations of **Bessel-Fourier Series!!!**
The document introduces to a theorem on how to find coefficients of respective Bessel Function in this expansion.
Don't miss out to read the conclusion part as it has a good insight on importance on this Bessel Series!.

## Visualisation of Bessel Functions
This [file](#visualisation%of%Bessel%Function%of%Different%orders.ipynb) Has a python code and it can be run to look at how a particular Bessel function of given order looks like.

This [code](#temperature_distribution.ipynb) has a basic solved example,to solve for temperature distribution over a circular disk as function of time and radius using Bessel Functions.
